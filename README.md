# EDA-Fundamentals---Python-Coding---Dummy-Dataset
### *I recently worked on a complete EDA workflow using a dummy dataset to demonstrate how data insights can drive business decisions. The dataset includes customer demographics (Age, Gender), financials (Annual Income), behaviour (Spending Score), and outcomes (Churn).*

## ***The project covers:***

### -> Data Inspection & Cleaning (checking nulls, data types, summary stats)

### -> Univariate Analysis (distributions of age, gender, income, spending score)

### -> Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis (relationships between income, spending, churn)

### -> Correlation Study (identifying key churn indicators)

### -> Feature Engineering (age-group segmentation)


## ***Key Insights:***

### -> Spending Score is the strongest churn predictor.

### -> Income has little impact on spending, highlighting the need for behaviour-based segmentation.

### -> Younger customers spend more, while older groups show higher churn risk.


## ***Recommendations:***
### -> Retention strategies should target low-spending customers, with personalised offers and loyalty programs.
